# Docs

Project docs entrypoint: [`index.md`](./index.md)

If you publish with GitHub Pages from `/docs`, this file remains useful for repo browsing while `index.md` acts as the site landing page.

Note: the docs use Markdown links to `*.md` for GitHub repo browsing, and Jekyll rewrites them to `*.html` at build time (via `jekyll-relative-links`).
